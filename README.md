TeamCal Neo is a web application of a day-based calendar. It's generic purpose is the absence and event management of employees, project teams, music bands and other groups needing a scheduler.

"Neo" is is the successor of the popular Pro version, completely rewritten, HTML5 and CCS3 compliant and responsive.

The goal of "Neo" remained the same, to create an optically attractive but also effective calendar display, showing the presences, absences and other events. TeamCal Neo supports the customization of holiday types, absence types and much more, thus its purpose can be altered to any graphical representation of timeline based processes or activities, e.g. a simple project plan or an event management.

## New in Version 3

TeamCal Neo 3 now requires a **proper license** and is not free anymore.
However, a separate free version with restricted features, TeamCal Neo Basic,
is available too. Read all about it here:

Only update to TeamCal Neo 3 after you obtained a valid license. You can then
activate and register your license from within your installation.
This process is documented here:

        Make sure that no user has selected this theme before you switch it
        back on.
