# TeamCal Neo 
TeamCal Neo is a web application of a day-based calendar. It's generic purpose is the absence and event management of project teams, music bands and other groups needing a scheduler.

"Neo" is is the successor of the popular Pro version, completely rewritten, HTML5 and CCS3 compliant and responsive. 

The goal of "Neo" remained the same, to create an optically attractive but also effective calendar display, showing the presences, absences and other events. TeamCal Neo supports the customization of holiday types, absence types and much more, thus its purpose can be altered to any graphical representation of timeline based processes or activities, e.g. a simple project plan or an event management.
