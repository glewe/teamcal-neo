Importing data from TeamCal Pro
===============================
If you have used TeamCal Pro before and want to import data from it, TeamCal
Neo offers such an option through it's GUI.
 
(!) However...

TeamCal Neo has been completely rewritten. Specifically the database has seen 
many structural changes. It is not compatible anymore to TeamCal Pro. You can 
only import core data from TeamCal Pro. You have to still adjust TeamCal Neo 
settings after.

It is important that you have upgraded your TeamCal Pro instance to the latest 
release TeamCal Pro 3.6.019 (or higher) before you attempt these imports.

Your TeamCal Pro database will not be changed, just read.
