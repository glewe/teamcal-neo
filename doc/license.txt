TEAMCAL NEO LICENSE
==============================================================================

In addition to the GPL license (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) 
you agree to the following conditions if you decide to use or modify TeamCal Neo:

1. You may NOT alter or disable comments, references, statements and displays 
   of the:
   - Application information (name, version) (exception see under 3.)
   - Author's information (name, URL, e-mail)
   - Author's copyright
   - "Powered by" information in the footer (must be displayed on each page)
   - Help-About page (exception see under 3.)

2. You may alter the footer copyright name (see Framework Configuration)

3. If you develop identifyable sections of code that are not derived from the 
   original application and can be reasonably considered as independent and 
   separate work in themselves, like an integration module for a CMS, you may 
   identify your new sections by appropriate references to you as the modifying
   author. In such a case you may also alter the version number of the 
   Application based on the original version number in order to reflect the 
   independent additions to the Application (e.g. 3.5.002 => 3.5.002m). 
   You may also add information about your mod to the About page.

4. Creation of modifications does not change the license agreements and usage 
   classification. All conditions still apply.

5. Usage of modifications under different license conditions than the original 
   are not allowed and still require the same support fee.

6. Distribution of modifications are not allowed.

*Commercial use of TeamCal Neo requires licensing.*
