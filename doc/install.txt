Languages
---------
TeamCal Neo supports different languages. The distribution comes with 
an English and German language file. You are free to add more languages 
which is a fairly easy process.

Make a copy of languagesg/english.php (or any other language you wanna base
your translation on) and name it according to the language you are preparing, 
e.g. portugese.php.
 
Open your new language file and change the original lanuguage values to 
Portugese. Make sure not to touch any of the PHP code around it. Also there 
might be some strings beginning or ending with blanks. These blanks are used on 
purpose and are displayed in TeamCal Neo. You will have to leave them there if 
the language you are building bases on the same grammar and structure as English.
If that is not the case play around with the values and see how it looks when 
you view TeamCal Neo with your file.

Where there are white spaces (&nbsp;) it is important you use them too if you 
have blanks in the string you wanna use. The white spaces avoid that the 
browsers uses carriage returns.
