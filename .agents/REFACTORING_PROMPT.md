This is a legacy PHP web application. I want to refactor it with the following goals in mind:

- make it more secure
- make it more object oriented (e.g. classes instead of global objects)
- better separation between models, views and controllers
- make it faster
- keep the current frontend design and styles

Scan and review the code and suggest a plan for such a refactoring.
